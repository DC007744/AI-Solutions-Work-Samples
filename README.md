### About:
Microsoft Outlook AI Copilot is a custom add-in app that integrates the capabilities of ChatGPT within the Microsoft Outlook Mail app. Specially developed for client-facing teams, this app aims to:
- Increase team members' efficiency                [saving at least 5 hours/week with AI-powered email drafting]
- Reduce a company's overall turnaround time       [enabling team members to keep track of action items with AI-powered task list generator]
- Reduce errors in written communication           [grammar and tone correction using AI]
- Enable teams to seek professional advice from AI [users can chat with the AI assistant and get advice on an email message]

As a result, this will elevate a company's customer service and enable teams to focus more on what matters.
